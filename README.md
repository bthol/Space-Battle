# Space Battle

**Developer**: Blake Thollaug

**Description**: Fight off the alien hoarde for a new high score in this turn-based arcade-style battle game. User takes turns fighting with one enemy at a time by choosing from four moves, some of which have a chance to work, and some of which require a certain number of turns to charge. Enemies are randomly generated from a list of various enemy types, where enemy types differ by name, health, damage, and score on defeat. Every so many enemies, a new boss enemy is generated. The game is lost when the playerâ€™s health goes below zero and won when the final boss is defeated. A new high score will be saved even on loss, so there is no reason not to try your luck in Space Battle!
